# KUtilities
KUtilites are scripts which I personally use in my Unity projects to avoid having to rewrite them over and over again. The collection may be implemented completely or partially in your projects.

Please keep in mind the folder structure, if you have more than one script in one folder they belong together. Also pay attention to a link in the scripts. This links to a video that shows the functionality of the script.
